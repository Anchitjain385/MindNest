## Brief Description of our project
MindNest is an AI-powered mobile application designed to detect early signs of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Leveraging multi-modal emotion analysis (text, voice, and facial cues), the app provides personalized support through an AI therapist, mood tracking, calming games, and SOS features.

The app addresses the problem of underdiagnosed mental health issues due to stigma, lack of awareness, and limited access to care. It incorporates advanced NLP, facial recognition using MediaPipe + TensorFlow Lite, and voice analysis to understand a userâ€™s emotional state in real time. The AI then responds with empathetic feedback, coping strategies, and emergency support if needed.

Designed for low-resource devices with multilingual access and offline capability, MindNest aims to democratize mental healthcare across India, especially in underserved areas. Its psychology-informed design ensures a soothing user experience, promoting emotional literacy and proactive mental health management.
